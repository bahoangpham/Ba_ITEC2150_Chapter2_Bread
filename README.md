Create Superclass with instance variables, Default constructors, all arguments construtors, getters, setters, toString(), getIngredients() - list of all ingredients, bake() - change status from not ready to baked
Create first Subclass SourdoughBread with instance variables, Default constructors, all arguments construtors, getters, setters, toString(), recipeSourdough()
--> tString() must include getters that belong to Superclass as the output displays variables belong to Superclass and Subclass
--> recipeSourdough() just called from Subclass
So on to next 4 Subclasses
Create Testerclass and display following outputs of each Subclass: ingredients, recipe, bake status to baked
